# Wag-CC-OBJC

Hello! Welcome to my very first Obj-C project! Im sure there are a few lines of code in here that truly speaks to my developement level. I belive I call the [self.tableView]reloadData] method a few hundred times. Ha Ha

I tried my best to have this code be as MVC'd as I could. I do wish that I had created a more methods to break up my cellForRow code...

That being said, I had a great time working on this challenge. I've never worked with Obj-C before and It was a really great learning experiance for me. My two biggest hurdles on this challnge was how to properly create closures and getting my tableView to populate its data on first launch - [Hense all the reloadDatas ;) ]

Please send any feedback you may have my way. kpfister@me.com - Im sure there are better ways to acomplish some of the tasks I created in here and I would love any oppurtunity to improve.

Thank you!

Cheers :D
